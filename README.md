To get assets required by the program, please download

You could put it in ~/kibi-assets/

This archive contains:
* fonts to train the ANN
* images to test all the OCR's parts
* dictionnaries required by Robert (in different languages)
* weights generated by the ANN

All of these things can be personalized by every developers so that
everyone can have its own assets.

Plus, these heavy files shouldn't be stored on github.
