To get assets required by the program, please download

[http://too.gy/kibi-assets.tar.bz2](http://too.gy/kibi-assets.tar.bz2)

You could put it in ~/kibi-assets/

> This archive contains
> * fonts to train the ANN
> * images to test all the OCR's parts
> * dictionnaries required by Robert (in different languages)
> * weights generated by the ANN

All of this things can be personalized by the different developers, so that
everyone can have its own assets.

Plus, these heavy files shouldn't be stored on github.
