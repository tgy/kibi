<p>The final step before truly recognize the characters is to find them. This is
the third sort of detection so far in the process (the first one being skew
detection, and the second one the noise)</p>

<p>What are we working on in this part ? The picture has been loaded, rotated so
the text is straight, it then ran through various filters so it is now composed
only of pure black and white pixels, and we can expect it to be free of unwanted
noises.</p>

<h2 id="lines">Lines</h2>

<p>First, let's find text lines. To do this we need a vertical histogram of the
image, it is a simple list representing the number of black pixels in each pixel
line and it is computed linear time.</p>

<p>With this histogram, we make blocks of continuous non-empty lines. As
each text line is separated by a few rows of white pixels, they usually split
extremely well.</p>

<p>For exemple in the following text picture:
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem.png" alt="Detection exemple -- original"
title="" /></p>

<p>Our program recognize all the lines like this:
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_line1.bmp" alt="Line detection exemple
-- line 1" title="" />
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_line2.bmp" alt="Line detection exemple
-- line 2" title="" />
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_line3.bmp" alt="Line detection exemple
-- line 3" title="" /></p>

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

<p>Detecting characters rely essentially on the same principle. This time we
compute the horizontal histogram of each line, then recreate blocks of
continuous non-empty columns.</p>

<p>For exemple the following line:
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_line1.bmp" alt="Characters detection
exemple -- line 1" title="" /></p>

<p>Gives the following characters:</p>

<p><img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char1.bmp" alt="Characters detection
exemple -- line 1" title="" />
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char2.bmp" alt="Characters detection

exemple -- line 13" title="" />
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char14.bmp" alt="Characters detection
exemple -- line 14" title="" />
and so on…</p>

<h2 id="thresholding">Thresholding</h2>

<p>Sometimes, characters are so close to each others that there is no empty
columns
between them.</p>

<p>A naive solution is to define what is an "empty line", our first choice was
to
let a column with a few black pixel be empty anyway, this number being relative
to the size of the picture.</p>

<p>In the previous exemple, this threshold is set to 3, let's see what happen if
we
increase or decrease this threshold.</p>

<p>With a threshold of 4 in this line, we sometimes get "two in one" characters
like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char_merge.bmp" alt="Characters
detection exemple -- char merge" title="" /></p>

<p>And with a threshold of 2, some characters are truncated like this n:</p>

<p><img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char_strip1.bmp" alt="Characters
detection exemple -- char strip 1" title="" />
<img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char_strip2.bmp" alt="Characters
detection exemple -- char strip 2" title="" /></p>

<h2 id="futureimprovements">Future improvements</h2>

<p>At this point, we can think of two improvement axes for this module:</p>

<h3 id="improvethethresholding">Improve the thresholding</h3>

<p>Though it works well, the current thresholding is very naive. An idea would
be
to take count of distance between black pixels. This way we could increase the
number of autorized black pixel in an "empty line" and detect correctly this
kind of pattern as two different letters:</p>

<p><img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char_merge.bmp" alt="Characters
detection exemple -- char merge 2" title="" /></p>

<p>but still see this one as one single character:</p>

<p><img src="http://dettorer.net/ocr/lorem_char24.bmp" alt="Characters detection
exemple -- line 14" title="" /></p>

<p>The next (and a bit more complicated improvement) will be to detect
continuous
lines in a smarter way, keep track of the usual character width, or even use the
neural network to sort out those particular cases.</p>

<h3 id="detecttextzones">Detect text zones</h3>

<p>The only important issue of our detection block module is that it easily get
fooled by picture like this one:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.schmanck.de/text.jpg" alt="Text zone improvement --
typical exemple" title="" /></p>

<p>Our algorithm cannot see the lines next to the decorated 'H' as it make all
the
lines non-empty.</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to detect <em>where</em> the text is, isolate it in
boxes and
apply the other algorithms in these boxes only.</p>

</hr>

<p>The main part of this project was to create a neural network which had to be
able to recognize the characters of a piece of text.</p>

<p>An artificial neural network, often just called a neural network, is a
mathematical model inspired by biological neural networks. A neural network
consists of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, and it processes
inform ation using a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases a
neural network is an adaptive system that changes its structure during a
learning phase. Neural networks are used to model complex relationships between
inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.</p>

<p>The word network in the term 'artificial neural network' refers to the
inter–connections between the neurons in the different layers of each system.
An example system has three layers. The first layer has input neurons, which
send data via synapses to the second layer of neurons, and then via more
synapses to the third layer of output neurons. More complex systems will have
more layers of neurons with some having increased layers of input neurons and
output neurons. The synapses store parameters called "weights" that manipulate
the data in the calculations.</p>

<h2 id="learningbackpropagation">Learning : backpropagation</h2>

<p>Backpropagation is a common method of training artificial neural networks so
as
to minimize the objective function.
It requires a dataset of the desired output for many inputs, making up the
training set. It is most useful for feed-forward networks (networks that have
no feedback, or simply, that have no connections that loop).</p>

<p>For better understanding, the backpropagation learning algorithm can be
divided
into two phases: propagation and weight update.</p>

<h3 id="phase1propagation">Phase 1: Propagation</h3>

<p>Each propagation involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forward propagation of a training pattern's input through the neural
  network
  in order to generate the propagation's output activations.</li>
  <li>Backward propagation of the propagation's output activations through the
  neural network using the training pattern's target in order to generate the
  deltas of all output and hidden neurons.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="phase2weightupdate">Phase 2: Weight update</h3>

<p>For each weight-synapse follow the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiply its output delta and input activation to get the gradient of the
  weight.</li>
  <li>Bring the weight in the opposite direction of the gradient by subtracting
  a
  ratio of it from the weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ratio influences the speed and quality of learning; it is called the
learning rate. The sign of the gradient of a weight indicates where the error
is increasing, this is why the weight must be updated in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>We then repeat the function until the result is satisfying.</p>
