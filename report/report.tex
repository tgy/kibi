\chapter*{Introduction}

This document will present the current state of our project, KiBiOCR, as part of
EPITA's syllabus. KiBiOCR's name speaks for itself. It is an OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) program. Its goal is then to recognize characters in a
given image.\\

You will see that our project is breaked up in 5 very distinct parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Lenna}: preprocessing part of the program. Lenna modifies user's input
        image to help other parts of the program to do their job.
    \item{Freddy}: `he' is in charge of the segmentation part, which is
        identifying images, paragraphs, words and characters positions.
    \item{Anna}: this is our artificial neural network (ANN). `She' identifies
        characters segmented by Freddy.
    \item{\emph{(Le petit)} Robert}: this is our dictionary. `He' detects the
        document language and errors made by Anna/Freddy in the identification
        process and then try to find the nearest words.
    \item{Guy}: our user interface. This is the way our program and the user
        will be able to interact.
\end{itemize}

We gave surnames to the parts of our program because we like private jokes but
mainly because shortnames are really convenient when we talk about our project.

\chapter*{Conclusion}

Our project is moving forward very well. Our team is organized, we are all
working with passion and seriousness. We often schedule meetings and establish
task lists so that everyone is aware of what has to be done and can pick up
something he is interested in. \\

Some very tough tasks are waiting for us and we hope we will be able to show up
at the final with a fresh and working piece of art.
