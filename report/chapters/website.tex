\section{Python}

\begin{center}
\end{center}

This year, we decided to switch from PHP to Python. We think that Python is a
stronger and more relevant language and we wanted to learn its syntax and its
specifics. So, here we are. \\

Plus, if we want to put our OCR online so that people can use it via a web
interface, it would me so much easier to do it with Python than with PHP. Python
can easily call other programs and execute commands on the server in a very
secure way. It is more complicated with PHP.

\section{Django}

\begin{center}
\end{center}

There is a very nice Python web framework out there on the web that is called
Django. Working with Django is quick: it is made for rapid development and for
perfectionists (we are).

\section{Nginx}

\begin{center}
\end{center}

We wanted to use something else than a basic Apache server so we decided to go
with Nginx, a quick, clean and easy to configure web server.

\section{Github}

\begin{center}
\end{center}

Our code is hosted on the now very famous website (and git server) GitHub. For
the moment, it is located in a private repository (for obvious reasons) but we
plan to go opensource once the last soutenance will be passed!
